# PumpTrack – Personal Workout Logger

## 📘 Case Title
**PumpTrack – Personal Workout Logger**

## 🏁 Background
Fitness enthusiasts often want to track their progress, but lack a **simple, flexible, and motivating** tool to log workouts and set goals.  
Most existing apps are either **too complex**, **too generic**, or **cluttered with unnecessary features**, making it difficult to get a clear overview of personal development.

All while maintaining a clean, responsive, and motivating interface.

## 👥 Target Users
- Regular gym-goers or athletes who want to record their training.
- Beginners who need an easy way to stay consistent.
- Experienced users who value clear analytics and goal tracking.

## ⚙️ Core Functionality

### **Must Have (MVP)**
- User registration and authentication  
- Log workouts (date, type, duration, intensity, notes)  
- View workout history and progress  
- Set and manage personal fitness goals  

### **Nice to Have (Optional Extensions)**
- Interactive statistics and progress graphs  
- Calendar view for visualizing workout frequency  
- Share workouts or progress with friends  
- **Natural language input** (e.g., “Ran 5k in 25 minutes”)  
- **Smart goal suggestions** based on past data and performance trends
