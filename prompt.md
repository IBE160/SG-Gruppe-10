## Case Title
PumpTrack – Personal Workout Logger

## Background
Fitness enthusiasts often want to track their progress, but lack a simple and flexible tool to log workouts and goals. Many existing apps are either too complex or too generic, and don’t provide a clear overview of personal development.

## Purpose
To build a web application where users can log their workouts, set goals, and monitor progress – with a focus on simplicity, clarity, and motivation.

## Target Users
People who train regularly and want to keep track of their workouts, goals, and progress. This includes both beginners and experienced users.

## Core Functionality

### Must Have (MVP)
- Feature 1: User registration and authentication
- Feature 2: Log workouts with date, type, duration, and notes
- Feature 3: View workout history and set personal goals

### Nice to Have (Optional Extensions)
- Feature 4: Statistics and graphs showing progress over time
- Feature 5: Share workouts with friends and calendar view

## Data Requirements

- Data entity 1: Users – name, email, password
- Data entity 2: Workouts – date, workout type, duration, intensity, notes
- Data entity 3: Goals – goal type, start value, target value, progress
- Data entity 4: Progress – date, value, linked goal

## User Stories (Optional)

1. As a user, I want to log my workouts, so that I can track my progress over time.
2. As a user, I want to set personal goals, so that I stay motivated.
3. As a user, I want to view statistics, so that I can see how I improve.

## Technical Constraints

- Must be mobile-responsive
- Must support user authentication
- Must validate required fields (e.g., date, duration)
- Must use FastAPI (backend), Next.js (frontend), PostgreSQL (database)
- Must use Git with AI-generated commit messages
- Must be developed using BMAD-METHOD™ and Gemini CLI

## Success Criteria

- Criterion 1: Users can create, view, and manage their workouts and goals
- Criterion 2: Data persists across sessions and is securely stored
- Criterion 3: Application is responsive and intuitive to use
- Criterion 4: AI tools are actively used and documented throughout the development process
