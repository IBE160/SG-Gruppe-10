# Brainstorming Session Results

**Session Date:** fredag 31. oktober 2025
**Facilitator:** Business Analyst Mary
**Participant:** BIP

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** Brainstorming improvements for proposal.md, focusing on User Stories.

**Session Goals:** The goal is focused ideation on the "User Stories" section of the proposal.md file.

**Techniques Used:** User Journey Mapping

**Total Ideas Generated:** 3 User Stories, 12+ key insights

### Key Themes Identified:

*   **Frictionless Experience:** The user journey should be as simple and fast as possible, from discovery to regular use.
*   **Motivation through Feedback:** The app should provide constant, positive reinforcement through visuals (badges, streaks) and smart suggestions.
*   **Intelligent Partnership:** The app should feel like a smart coach, not just a passive logging tool, by offering proactive and personalized guidance.

## Technique Sessions

### User Journey Mapping

We began mapping the user journey for the PumpTrack application, focusing on four key stages. We detailed the user's actions, thoughts, feelings, and key opportunities for each stage.

**Stage 1: Discovery**
*   **User Insights:** Users are inspired by friends' shared achievements. They are curious but cautious, wanting to quickly understand the app's value, cost, and ease of use.
*   **Key Opportunities:** Make shared posts visually compelling and informative. Answer key user questions (pricing, platform) upfront.

**Stage 2: Onboarding**
*   **User Insights:** Users are impatient and want to sign up in seconds. Social sign-ins and clear, minimal steps are crucial.
*   **Key Opportunities:** One-click signup, immediate personalization, and clear communication of simplicity (e.g., "No credit card required").

**Stage 3: First Use**
*   **User Insights:** Users are excited but slightly unsure. They expect an effortless and "smart" logging experience.
*   **Key Opportunities:** Natural Language Input, a prominent "Quick Add" button, and instant, encouraging feedback after the first action.

**Stage 4: Regular Use (In Progress)**
*   **User Insights:** Users are motivated but time-conscious. They seek validation (streaks, progress) and proactive guidance.
*   **Key Opportunities:** AI-driven suggestions, personalized nudges, and clear, visual progress feedback.

## Reflection and Follow-up

### What Worked Well

The User Journey Mapping technique was effective in systematically exploring the user's experience and uncovering key needs and opportunities at each stage.

### Areas for Further Exploration

*   Complete the "Regular Use" stage of the journey map.
*   Explore the "Achieving a Goal" stage.
*   Brainstorm user stories for the insights gathered in the later stages.

### Recommended Follow-up Techniques

*   Continue with **User Journey Mapping**.
*   Use **"How Might We..." Statements** to turn the opportunities we've identified into actionable design challenges.
