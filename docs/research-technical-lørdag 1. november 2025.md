# Technical Research Report: Pydantic for PumpTrack Project

## 1. Research Objective

The primary objective of this research was to evaluate Pydantic as the data validation and modeling library for the PumpTrack project's FastAPI backend. The user, BIP, sought to understand why Pydantic is recommended, its advantages, potential limitations, and viable alternatives, given the project's academic, greenfield, and proof-of-concept nature.

## 2. Project Context: PumpTrack

*   **Project Type:** Greenfield project for academic purposes.
*   **Requirement:** Only a Proof of Concept (POC) is required.
*   **Core Functionality:** Logging workouts, setting goals, and monitoring progress.
*   **Technical Stack:**
    *   Frontend: Next.js + Tailwind CSS
    *   Backend: FastAPI (Python)
    *   Database/Auth: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth)

## 3. Requirements and Constraints for Pydantic

### Functional Requirements (for Pydantic)
*   Validate and serialize/deserialize user input (e.g., workout logs, goals).
*   Ensure type safety and data integrity across API endpoints.
*   Support nested models (e.g., a workout with embedded goal progress).
*   Provide clear error messages for invalid data.
*   Integrate smoothly with FastAPI request/response models.
*   Enable easy conversion between Python objects and JSON.
*   Support optional fields and default values.
*   Handle datetime parsing and formatting.

### Non-Functional Requirements (for Pydantic)
*   **Simplicity, Reliability, Developer Experience:** High priority for this academic project.
*   **Performance:** Good enough for low-latency validation and serialization during frequent operations (logging workouts, updating goals).
*   **Scalability:** Cleanly structured to allow future scalability, though not a primary concern for POC.
*   **Reliability:** Consistent behavior during testing and demos; Pydantic's strict type enforcement aids this.
*   **Security:** Handled through proper input validation by Pydantic.
*   **Maintainability:** Pydantic's declarative syntax and FastAPI compatibility are ideal for building, reading, and extending models within a limited timeframe.

### Constraints
*   **Programming Language:** Python (FastAPI backend).
*   **Cloud Platform:** Supabase for database and authentication (free-tier friendly).
*   **Budget:** Zero (all tools must be open source or free).
*   **Team Expertise:** Limited experience; stack needs to be beginner-friendly, well-documented, and quick to learn.
*   **Timeline:** Short (six weeks); rapid development and minimal setup are essential.
*   **Licensing:** Permissively licensed tools.

## 4. Technology Options and Comparative Analysis

### Pydantic
*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Seamless FastAPI Integration:** Automatic request/response validation, serialization, and OpenAPI documentation.
    *   **Type Hinting:** Leverages native Python type hints for clean, readable code, static analysis, and autocompletion.
    *   **Performance:** Very fast due to Rust-implemented core validation logic.
    *   **Ease of Use:** Intuitive syntax, easy to learn.
    *   **Rich Feature Set:** Supports complex data structures, custom validation, and a growing ecosystem.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Less Flexibility in Schema Definition:** Schema is tied to class definition, potentially less flexible for multiple data representations.
    *   **Tightly Coupled to Models:** Validation logic is part of the model class.

### Marshmallow
*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Decoupled Schemas:** Uses separate `Schema` classes, allowing multiple schemas for the same data model.
    *   **Flexibility:** Highly customizable and adaptable.
    *   **Mature and Stable:** Long-standing library with an active community.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **More Verbose:** Schema definition is generally more verbose than Pydantic.
    *   **No Automatic FastAPI Integration:** Requires more manual setup for integration and features.

### Python Dataclasses
*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Built-in:** Part of the standard library (Python 3.7+), no external dependencies.
    *   **Lightweight:** Minimal overhead for simple data structures.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **No Built-in Validation:** No out-of-the-box data validation or type coercion.
    *   **Limited Functionality:** Primarily for data-holding classes, lacks advanced features like serialization.

### Conclusion on Pydantic
Given the project's context, especially the use of FastAPI, Pydantic is the **strongest recommendation**. Its seamless integration, automatic validation, documentation generation, and developer-friendly syntax make it the most efficient and effective choice for this academic greenfield project.

## 5. Key Architectural and Development Considerations

### FastAPI Project Structure
A modular structure is recommended for scalability and maintainability:
```
/your_project_name
|-- /app
|   |-- main.py             # FastAPI app instance
|   |-- api/                # API endpoints (e.g., v1/endpoints/workouts.py)
|   |-- core/               # Configuration (e.g., config.py)
|   |-- db/                 # Database session management
|   |-- models/             # SQLAlchemy ORM models
|   `-- schemas/            # Pydantic models
|-- requirements.txt
`-- .env
```

### Pydantic Model Organization
Pydantic models should be organized in the dedicated `schemas/` directory, with one file per major feature (e.g., `workout.py`, `user.py`). This centralizes them and promotes reusability.

### Database Relationships (Supabase/PostgreSQL)
Relationships are handled using **foreign keys** in PostgreSQL. When using SQLAlchemy ORM, these relationships are defined in your Python models (e.g., `User` has `Workouts`, `Workout` has `Goals`).

### Async Database Queries with Supabase and FastAPI
**Yes, use async queries.** FastAPI is asynchronous, and synchronous database calls will block the event loop. Utilize `asyncpg` with SQLAlchemy's async support or a library like `databases` for non-blocking I/O.

### Secure Management of Environment Variables and Secrets
*   Use a `.env` file for local development (add to `.gitignore`).
*   Use environment variables in production.
*   Load variables using `python-dotenv` and Pydantic's `BaseSettings` for type-safe configuration.

### Unit Testing FastAPI Endpoints
*   Use `pytest` with FastAPI's `TestClient`.
*   `TestClient` allows making requests to your app without a running server.
*   Write tests that simulate API calls and assert on status codes and response data.

### Automated Testing and CI/CD
**GitHub Actions** is recommended. It's free for public repositories and integrates directly with GitHub, allowing you to run tests automatically on every push.

### Database Seeding with Test Data
Create a separate Python script (e.g., `seed.py`) that uses your SQLAlchemy models and database connection to populate the database with initial data. This is more maintainable than raw SQL.

### Connecting Next.js to FastAPI Securely and Efficiently
*   Next.js will make HTTP requests to FastAPI.
*   Enable **CORS** in FastAPI using `CORSMiddleware` to allow requests from your Next.js domain.
*   **Authentication:** After user login via Supabase Auth, the Next.js app receives a JWT. This token must be included in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header for all protected requests to FastAPI. FastAPI will then validate this token.

### State Management in Next.js
*   For simple state, React's `useState` and `useContext` hooks are sufficient.
*   For more complex state, consider lightweight libraries like **Zustand** or **Jotai**.

### Visualizing Progress (Charts, Streaks)
Use a JavaScript charting library like **`react-chartjs-2`** (a React wrapper for `Chart.js`). Fetch data from your FastAPI backend and pass it to the chart components for rendering various visualizations.

## 6. Documentation & AI Usage

### Documenting AI Usage (Gemini CLI)
*   Create an `ai-usage.md` file.
*   For each interaction, record: Date/Timestamp, Goal/Question, Prompt, AI's Response, and Your Implementation/Reflection.

### Format for `ai-usage.md` and `bmad-log.md`
*   Both should use Markdown.
*   `ai-usage.md`: Detailed log of AI interactions with prompts, responses, and reflections.
*   `bmad-log.md`: High-level chronological log of development tasks and the AI agent used.

### Tracking and Explaining AI-Generated Decisions in Git Commits
*   Use a prefix like `[AI]` or `[Gemini]` in commit messages for AI-influenced changes.
*   In the commit body, explain the AI's contribution and reference the `ai-usage.md` file for full context.
