# Brainstorming Session Results

**Session Date:** Sunday, 2 November 2025
**Facilitator:** Business Analyst Mary
**Participant:** BIP

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** Brainstorming 'Off-Track' Scenarios for PumpTrack

**Session Goals:** To generate ideas for how PumpTrack can support users when they are not actively pursuing their fitness goals, specifically when they are struggling with motivation, injured, or taking a break.

**Techniques Used:** Assumption Reversal

**Total Ideas Generated:** 6 (Zen Mode, Smart Recovery Tips, Goal-Oriented Reminders, Celebrate Rest Days, Consistency Calendar, Consistency Badges)

### Key Themes Identified:

A shift towards a more holistic and compassionate view of fitness.

## Technique Sessions

### Assumption Reversal: "The user *does not* want to be reminded to work out."

*   **Idea:** "Zen Mode" - a low-pressure mode focused on recovery and maintenance.
    *   **Associated Ideas:** Smart recovery tips (appear after tough workouts); Celebrate rest days (with "Recovery Streaks" and "Rest Day" badges).

### Assumption Reversal: "The user is *not* motivated by seeing their progress go up."

*   **Idea:** Focus on consistency over performance.
    *   **Associated Ideas:** Consistency calendar (visual graph of active days); Consistency badges (for weekly goals and variety).

### Assumption Reversal: "A missed workout is *not* a failure."

*   **Idea:** Reframing "missed" workouts as learning opportunities; Goal-oriented reminders.

## Idea Categorization

### Immediate Opportunities (Quick wins we could implement soon)

*   "Zen Mode"
*   Smart recovery tips
*   Goal-oriented reminders

### Future Innovations (Promising ideas that need more development)

*   Celebrate rest days (with "Recovery Streaks" and "Rest Day" badges)
*   Consistency badges (for weekly goals and variety)
*   Consistency calendar (a visual graph of active days)

### Moonshots (Bold, long-term concepts)

_None explicitly identified in this session, but the overarching theme of holistic wellness could lead to future moonshots._

### Insights and Learnings

Key realizations from the session:

1.  Rest is a productive part of fitness, and the app should celebrate it, not punish it.
2.  Consistency is more important than intensity for long-term success, and the app should be designed to encourage the habit of activity.
3.  A "supportive coach" is sometimes firm, and the app can hold users accountable by connecting their actions to their goals in a constructive way.

## Action Planning

### Top 3 Priority Ideas

#### #1 Priority: Smart recovery tips

-   Rationale: Recovery is an important feature so our clients can keep themselves active over a longer time.
-   Next steps:
    1.  Write 5-10 generic recovery tips.
    2.  Design a simple, non-intrusive UI element to display the tip on the post-workout screen.
    3.  Implement the logic to show a random tip after every workout is logged.
-   Resources needed: 1 developer, 1 designer/content writer.
-   Timeline: 2-3 days.

#### #2 Priority: Goal-oriented reminders

-   Rationale: It is important to have a clear goal to keep the client motivated.
-   Next steps:
    1.  Define the trigger: The reminder will be triggered when a user opens the app the day after they have missed a planned workout.
    2.  Design the message: The message will be a simple, non-dismissible banner at the top of the dashboard that says: "Remember your goal to [user's goal]. Every workout is a step forward. Let's make today count!"
    3.  Implement the logic: A developer will implement the logic to check for the missed workout and display the banner.
-   Resources needed: 1 developer.
-   Timeline: 3-4 days.

#### #3 Priority: Consistency badges

-   Rationale: It makes them feel a sort of progression through the app.
-   Next steps:
    1.  Define 3 initial badges:
        *   "Welcome Aboard!" (for completing the first workout)
        *   "Weekly Warrior" (for working out 3 times in one week)
        *   "Explorer" (for trying 2 different types of workouts)
    2.  Design simple badges: We'll use simple, pre-made icons or even just text-based "achievements" to start.
    3.  Display badges: We'll add a simple "My Achievements" section to the user's profile page where the earned badges are listed.
-   Resources needed: 1 developer (part-time).
-   Timeline: 2-3 days.
