# Product Brief: ApexTrack

## 1. Problem & Opportunity

Fitness hobbyists who are serious about their training often engage in both strength and cardio activities. They currently lack a single, cohesive platform that allows them to track detailed progress in both domains and share their achievements with a like-minded community. Existing apps tend to specialize in either strength or cardio, but rarely excel at both. 

**Opportunity:** We can capture a dedicated user base by providing a best-in-class, integrated tracking experience combined with focused community engagement features.

## 2. Target Audience

**Primary User:** The Fitness Hobbyist. 

This user is data-driven and motivated by seeing measurable progress. They are active in the gym and/or outdoors and are looking for a tool to consolidate their performance data. They are also motivated by community validation and enjoy sharing their successes.

## 3. Project Goals & Success Metrics

*   **Goal 1:** Deliver a seamless and detailed tracking experience for both strength and cardio workouts.
    *   **Metric:** High user retention rate after the first month.
*   **Goal 2:** Foster a supportive and engaging community around user achievements.
    *   **Metric:** High number of Personal Records (PRs) shared per user per week.
    *   **Metric:** High engagement rate (likes/comments) on shared posts.
*   **Goal 3:** Become the go-to app for multi-disciplinary fitness hobbyists.
    *   **Metric:** Consistent growth in Daily Active Users (DAU).
