### Case Title
PumpTrack – Personal Workout Logger

### Background
Fitness enthusiasts often want to track their progress, but lack a simple and flexible tool to log workouts and goals. Many existing apps are either too complex or too generic, and don’t provide a clear overview of personal development.

### Purpose
To build a web application where users can log their workouts, set goals, and monitor progress – with a focus on simplicity, clarity, and motivation.

### Target Users
People who train regularly and want to keep track of their workouts, goals, and progress. This includes both beginners and experienced users.

### Core Functionality
**Must Have (MVP)**
- User registration and authentication
- Log workouts with date, type, duration, and notes
- View workout history and set personal goals

**Nice to Have (Optional Extensions)**
- Statistics and graphs showing progress over time
- Share workouts with friends and calendar view
- Natural language input for logging workouts (e.g., "ran 5k in 25 minutes")
- Smart goal suggestions based on workout history

### Data Requirements
- Users: name, email, password
- Workouts: date, workout type, duration, intensity, notes
- Goals: goal type, start value, target value, progress
- Progress: date, value, linked goal
